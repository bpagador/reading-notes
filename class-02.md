new tags learned:

    <abbr> = abbreviation
    <cite> = citation
    <dfn> = defining instances 

Question: these tags are more functional than they are representational, does this meann that the source information related to each is hidden? Would you, for example, be able to see the abbreviation if you hovered over "NASA" (book example)? And in what type of project would <dfn> be more useful?

HTML/CSS
pg 226 - 245

    boolean:
        true
        false

    arithmatic operators:
        +
        -

JS
